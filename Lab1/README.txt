-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned quite a bit in the lab at hand. foremost I learned how to utilize multimedia logic. 
I learned to apply what we learned in class about logic gates
as well as truth tables to turn on the led lights. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
The second I got over the learning curve and understood what I was trying to accomplish everything came into place. 
However before I understood the goal of this project I found that I had no idea what I was doing.
it was veryh rewarding when I finally understood what was going on and what I needed
to do in order to get all the lights to work correctly.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
It is hard to say how I would redesign this lab due to my 
limited expierence in this sector but perhaps a very basic example with lights as a prelab tutorial wouldve 
been great in order to see what to do initially.
