-------------------------
The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings
(“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
Static data - (Addresses 0x1001 0000 - 0x1004 0000)

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
I believe that the learning objectives of this lab are to get you familiar with 
mips and mars mips simulator. With both these of these it makes us get used to registers
and storing values how to to loop and make branch statements in mips. Pretty much apply
the logic and previous coding knowledge from other courses with the knowledge weve
learned so far to a new language and hack away.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I honestly really enjoyed this lab, I felt like I was finally back to coding 
which is something I feel much more comfortable with. I really liked applying
 the things weve done in the class so far to this language as well.
figuring out how to store things in registers was hard at first.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
If I were to redesign the lab at hand I dont think I would change much
this lab was fairly straight forward and there was a ton of implmentation from the book 
that was helpful.
