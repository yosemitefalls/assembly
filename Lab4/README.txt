-------------------------
What was your approach to converting each decimal number to two’s complement
form?
My approach involved mainly if statements, its what the ta reccomended so its what I ended up doing.
looking baCK i kind of wish I used for loops.
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned alot mostly in regards to how things are stored in assembly and how to access them.
At the beggining I thought it was gunna be easy but it only started making sense when I understand
how and why things were stored the way they were
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
YES the extra credit done in the form of if statements was an aboslute nightmare to debug
I think i spent more time on that then the lab itself. I really shouldve done loops or something
but alas thats the way it goes. maybe I also thought that the the initial conversion was hard so 
yeah
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
maybe more in depth insturctions on what exactly you should do, I found it really hard to 
to get going on the some of the steps do to confusion on what exactly I was supposed to do
but besides that it was all good i think
