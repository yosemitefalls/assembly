What were the learning objectives of this lab?
I believe that the learning objectives of this lab were for us to get a complete understanding of the usage of logic gates and there applications in multi level 
programs. I believe another learning objective of this lab was for us to be able to be able to plan out a multi step multi layered
program in this new way. With a deeper understanding of architecture we will be able to think about computing differently and be 
able to apply what we learned to other things in the future.
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Finishing it, haha. But realistically I really enjoyed how everything worked togtether in unison to make this work.
I found that such a simple game really takes alot of work if you are to be programming it a such a low level
which I found somewhat interesting.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would expalin a bit more how to get started and what order we should do each thing in.  I found that once I opened the template
I immediately felt overwhelmed and lost. I would explain the process and what we should work on first if I was to redo 
this lab assignment.
