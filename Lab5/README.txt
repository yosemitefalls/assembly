-------------------------
What was your design approach?
Well I wrote the whole thing out step by step and kinda debugged as i went on. The first debug was the timing stuff 
then the string compare the char compare. It wasnt the best approach because I thought it was gunna be easier
then it was
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned the need to store things in remp reigsters do to memory overwriting. I also learned the value of sub routines (there kinda like methods) 
and jr ra (kinda like return statement) however in order to use them propoerly you have to implement a stack
which is what I did in order ot use them. Using all these things in coordination is what I learnedin this lab
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
compare strings was a massive pain, It turned out that I was iterating through the loop way too long and and I had iterate
until the byte im entering was null instead of interating for a set amount of times. I also needed to add an if statement if 
v0 was set to 0 to exit loops within the compare strings to exit in certain conditions.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would have liked the outline to be a bit more clear. Maybe what I was atttempting to do and more prompted reading for the assignment
at hand. Maybe have the diagram due before the lab to force me to think through it more. Probably a good idea in all honesty.
